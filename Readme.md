# Nomina

An addon that adds custom names (tags) to a selection of custom Doom monsters
and weapons.

In a perfect world, mod authors add tags to their custom classes. Currently,
there are a lot of mods that lack name definitions. In this case, the engine
falls back to class name. This addon tries to fix this by providing a database
of custom names.

## Supported names

* The Ultimate Torment & Torture
* DoomRL Arsenal
* Bullet-Eye
* Compendium
* REKKR
* Freedoom
* The Adventures of Square (Episodes 1 & 2)
* Eriguns 1 weapons
* LILA-DOOM weapons
* Hard Doom weapons
* Strife weapons
* Doom 64 weapons
* Project MSX weapons

## Name Sources

* War Trophies (Accensus, Tapwave)
* Target Spy (m8f)
* Weapon Menu (m8f)

## Thanks

* Proydoha for Freedoom corrections
