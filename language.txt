In multiplayer all renames propagate to other players (everybody see your\
changes). Despite that name changes are synchronized, there is still a chance of\
desyncing if some mod has logic that depends on monster/weapon tags, and players\
have different custom names from the start. Because of that, it's recommended to\
start with cleared custom names when playing with such mods.";
